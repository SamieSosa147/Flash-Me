# Project Proposal Example

## Project Choice

- [ ] Flash Cards

## Project Description

My app is called Trivia-o-Mama. It's a game app for players who want to play flashcards online. One players joins and plays a round of flashcards, with the score being kept automatically. The flash cards will not dissapper from the screen until the player accurectly guesses the item beneath the card. Users will have the option to play again [reset button]. In the future, I'd like to add a feature where one player can play against the computer.
